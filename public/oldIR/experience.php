              <p>
                <strong>Responsibilities</strong> -- My primary responsibilities in this position were to prepare

                <h2>Runner and Utility</h2> 
                <p><em>ESPN&#47;ABC</em> -- Tallahassee, FL<br /> August 2004 to November 2008</p>
              </header> 
              <p>
                <strong>Responsibilities</strong> -- This job was something that I did for fun more than money.  
                I started out as Utility and then became a Runner, though it would switch depending on what the 
                company needed on a specific day.  As a Utility, I did many jobs including running audio&#47;video 
                cables from trucks to the football field, set up audio&#47;video equipment on field, manned the 
                parabolic microphone on field during football games, and pull video cables for on-field cameramen.  
                As a Runner, I helped the producer with whatever they needed such as buying supplies for employees, 
                retrieving mail and packages, and handled paperwork and task-scheduling for day employees.

                2006 where I performed many of the same tasks as Impact, though I was also in charge of maintaining

                merchandise, rearrange stock room shelves to keep old and new merchandise organized, and print
