This is the source for the Interactive Resume of Evan Machnic. The site can be found at http://ir.broadmac.net. Obviously this is all written in Rails and the current version I'm using is Rails 2.3.5 and Ruby 1.8.7 because these are what is on the Dreamhost servers. I am planning on upgrading my site to Rails 3.0.0.beta because eventually we'll be there and I want to get some experience with some of the new features and changes. Please feel free to view and use my code, though it may not be as clean or DRY as it should be because I'm still learning. Also check out my Interactive Resume and drop me an email with comments/suggestions.

Thanks Everyone,

Evan Machnic
