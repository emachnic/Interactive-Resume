    Welcome!

    My name is Evan Machnic and I am an ambitious Web Developer. I have been building HTML and CSS web sites since
    2003 and recently have worked more with 
    = link_to "PHP", "http://php.net"
    and
    = link_to "Ruby on Rails", "http://rubyonrails.org"
    as well as
    = link_to "HTML5", "http://html5.org"
    \. I focus on creating high-quality,
    standards-based  web sites that look great and function exceptionally well. I believe the web should be
    accessible to everyone so I like to make my markup as semantic as possible. Please look through my
    = link_to "Portfolio", :controller => 'portfolio'
    and
    = link_to "About Me", :controller => 'about'
    sections to learn more about me and you can also find my contact information in the
    = link_to "Get in Touch", :controller => 'contact'
    section. You can download my print
