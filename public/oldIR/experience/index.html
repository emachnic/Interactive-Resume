					  <em>Andrew's Capital Grill and Bar</em> -- Tallahassee, FL<br /> 
					  June 2008 to Present
					</p> 
					<p>
						<strong>Responsibilities</strong> -- My primary responsibilities in this position were to prepare 
						the restaurant for opening, take customers' orders, expedite orders in the kitchen, bring food out 
						from the kitchen, clean tables during and after service, and help other servers if they needed.  
						I was also chosen by management to be a shift leader where I had to give servers different 
						responsibilities before and after shifts, and make sure that everything was done.  I also had to 
						provide support if the restaurant was busy to make sure that individual servers were not overwhelmed.

					  <em>ESPN&#47;ABC</em> -- Tallahassee, FL<br /> 
					  August 2004 to November 2008
					</p> 
					<p>
						<strong>Responsibilities</strong> -- This job was something that I did for fun more than money.  
						I started out as Utility and then became a Runner, though it would switch depending on what the 
						company needed on a specific day.  As a Utility, I did many jobs including running audio&#47;video 
						cables from trucks to the football field, set up audio&#47;video equipment on field, manned the 
						parabolic microphone on field during football games, and pull video cables for on-field cameramen.  
						As a Runner, I helped the producer with whatever they needed such as buying supplies for employees, 
						retrieving mail and packages, and handled paperwork and task-scheduling for day employees.

						<strong>Responsibilities</strong> -- I was hired at Abercrombie and Fitch as an Impact team member.  
						My responsibilities were to help customers find products, place sensors on incoming shipment, construct 
						product displays, and replenish merchandise on sales floor.  I was promoted to Lead Stock in November 
						2006 where I performed many of the same tasks as Impact, though I was also in charge of maintaining 
						the stock room.  I had to manage incoming shipment including scanning UPCs on boxes and sensor all 
						merchandise, rearrange stock room shelves to keep old and new merchandise organized, and print 
						replenishment reports then give those responsibilities to other impact members.

						<strong>Responsibilities</strong> -- This was a temporary position working for a high school
