      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The Florida State Department of Management Services (DMS) provides many 
        different services to the state agencies, some of which are: managing leases 
        of state facilities, human resources, and state purchasing. Recently an audit 
        was conducted by the Auditor General's office of the Facilities area in the 
        Real Estate division. One of the findings of the audit was that there is 
        currently no way to track and report the internal applications that employees 
        can access. Because of this, such an application must be created and Joe Wright, 
        the Chief Information Officer of DMS' Information Technology department, 
        is the sponsor of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proposed solution is to create a new application that will perform all of 
        the required tasks. Evan Machnic, who is the intern, will be given the responsibility 
        of designing and creating the application using the Ruby on Rails framework.  
        The main assumption on this project is that the application will be completed 
        in the five weeks from 30 June 2009 to 4 August 2009. Because of this, time is 
        also the biggest constraint. After the period of internship, the application 
        will continue to be maintained by DMS Information Technology employees.  
        This project plan details these points and discusses others as well.
      </p>

    <section id="intro">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Recently, the Auditor General's office of Florida conducted an audit of the Facilities 
        area within the Department of Management Services. The audit was performed in order to 
        identify inefficiencies and use those findings to create a better way of managing the divisions.
        One of the biggest roles of the Department of Management Services is managing the buildings 
        for the entire state of Florida, including the leases of private facilities. The key finding 
        is that there is no current way of reporting employees that have access to the various internal 
        applications used throughout DMS. The Information Technology office decided that an application 
        needed to be created to produce said reports and the application will be written in the Ruby on 
        Rails language and framework. In addition to the reporting capabilities, there needed to be ways
        to request and grant employee access to applications. The main focus is completing the capabilities 
        for the Facilities Operations Group of DMS though the application should be scalable to allow for 
        addition of other groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem that is fueling the need for this project is the inability to easily find out which 
        employees have access to the different internal applications. With the current system, if an 
        employee leaves or is terminated, the applications manager for that department must be notified 
        so that he/she can remove access for the former employee. The problem here is that frequently, 
        no notification is sent and the employee remains in the system even though he/she is no longer 
        employed. This creates for great inefficiencies as well as security vulnerabilities. It is 
        important to complete this project so that the current wasted money from inefficiencies can be 
        spent in an area that needs it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other problem that this application hopes to alleviate is the inability to print reports 
        with a list of employees and their approved applications. This is the main problem that the 
        auditor general found and probably would find in other departments. Fixing this problem would 
        help to fix the other one because if managers were able to view/print the reports then former 
        employees would easily be found. If these problems are not solved, then DMS could lose more 
        money and in an extreme circumstance, the management and employees may be replaced.

      <h3>Project Sponsor</h3>
      <p>
        The sponsor for this project is the Chief Information Officer for DMS, Joe Wright. Because 
        of this, Mr. Wright needs ways to easily generate various reports and the process should be 
        as unobtrusive as possible. The main purpose of this project from Mr. Wright's perspective 
        is that he needs to be able to view all employees and the applications to which they have access.
        These reports will be displayed on a computer screen as well as having the option to print and email.
      </p>

    <section id="solution">
      <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
      <p>
        The current solution to the previously discussed problems is to create a new, internal web 
        application. This application will be written in Ruby on Rails to utilize the model-view-controller 
        way of organizing applications. Many of the new applications for DMS are written in Ruby on Rails 
        because they can be written quickly and are very modular and scalable. The application will connect 
        to the DMS Central Directory, MySQL database which provides all of the needed information for tracking 
        and reporting. The milestones for this project will be: create a name and layout based around the 
        Central Directory's design; complete modifications of the database; three milestones coinciding with 
        creation of the Applications Manager, Supervising Manager and Departmental Manager sections; complete 
        tests on all aspects of the application; deploy the application to the server. The project will be 
        finished on August 4th, 2009 when Evan Machnic's internship finishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        After considering the needs of the organization, a solution was proposed to create a new application 
        with the needed functionality. The application will be designed and created by Evan Machnic with 
        help from other team members if needed. The plan is to use existing databases that will provide 
        most of the information, though they may require modification to accommodate the tracking abilities. 
        Because there are multiple roles involved, authentication will be implemented to allow access for 
        only specific roles. If a user does not have the required role, then he or she should not have the 
        option to access the restricted areas. This will simplify the application for the users as well as 
        keep it nice and thin. The biggest disadvantage to this plan is that everything will be created 
        from scratch and that requires more man-hours and thus more money.

      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <section id="goal">
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to decrease inefficiencies discovered through an internal audit by 
          creating a program to track employee access to internal web-based applications.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="obj1">
        <h4>Objective One</h4>
        <p>
          The first objective is to agree on a name for this application because it is going to be brand 
          new and not just plugged in to an existing application. After meeting with the group members, 
          the name that was agreed upon is "Application Approver" and a new banner was created to be the header. 
          This objective is important because the server needs to be set up with a new sub-domain before the 
          application can be deployed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="obj2">
        <h4>Objective Two</h4>
        <p>
          After agreeing upon a name, a method for login and authentication needs to be created.
          There are going to be three roles for the Application Approver: Requesting Manager, Administrator, 
          and Applications Manager. After the employee logs in, he or she will be directed to a section of 
          the site based on the role of that employee. The employee will not see any part of the application 
          that he or she does not need so as to avoid any confusion.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="obj3">
        <h4>Objective Three</h4>
        <p>
          The third objective is to create the Applications Manager section. This will only be visible to 
          employees with that role and will only have the functionality of changing an employee's status 
          from "Removed" or "Approved" to "Finished." The removed employees will come from nightly reports 
          sent from PeopleFirst and approved will come from the Administrator's approval. The updating 
          should only be done after that employee is added to or removed from an application within the 
          Applications Manager's division.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="obj4">
        <h4>Objective Four</h4>
        <p>
          Objective four is the creation of the Requesting Manager's section. This will include a "Search" 
          function for employees and then the ability to choose applications to request access for that 
          employee. The Rails plugin "searchLogic" will provide the searching capabilities instead of writing 
          a custom search because it provides all of the needed functions. This will also help immensely 
          with limited amount of time for this project.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="obj5">
        <h4>Objective Five</h4>
        <p>
          The fifth objective is making the Administrator section. The administrator will be able to log 
          in and immediately see all employees who have been requested. He or she can then approve that 
          employee which will notify the appropriate Applications Manager.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="obj6">
        <h4>Objective Six</h4>
        <p>
          The final objective is to commit the application to the repository and go live. There will be 
          usability testing done and possibly revisions done before the application is in use. Once the 
          application is tested and live then this will be the completion of the project.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="assumptions">
      <h3>Assumptions and Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        The Department of Management Services' biggest assumption is that Evan Machnic will be able to 
        finish the project in the allotted time. The internship did not officially begin until 30 June 
        2009 and it ends on 4 August 2009. This is a very limited time frame to create a web application 
        from the ground up, and assumes that Evan will not run into any difficult obstacles. Ideally, the 
        developer would have time to design and test both paper and electronic prototypes but the time 
        constraints allow only a limited amount of design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another assumption is that the current developers who know Ruby on Rails will continue employment 
        with the organization. Rails is a fairly new framework for the web, currently only at version 2.3.2. 
        It's use is on the rise because of the speed of getting an application up and running. The problem 
        is that most Ruby on Rails developers are in the Northern and Western United States. Currently, it 
        is difficult to find many Rails programmers in the Southeast. It is also a framework that is only 
        taught on a limited basis at Universities so DMS may run into trouble finding developers if it loses 
        any.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="alt">
      <h3>Alternative Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        One alternative solution is to add on to the existing Directory application. Since the database 
        being used is the same with some minor changes, this seems like the most logical alternative.
        Many of the functions such as role-based authentication, employee search, and sessions are already 
        in the Directory so they would not need to be re-created. This solution would save quite a bit of 
        time and with the constraints, makes a lot of sense. The problem here is that users may get confused 
        as to where to go for the application approval process. Currently, people already have to learn how 
        to use the new Directory and this would be another feature. The argument against that is by utilizing 
        the role-based authentication, users who do not have access would not even know that there is an 
        Application Approver, though in the end it was decided to keep the applications separate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another solution is to find an "off-the-shelf" application to perform the tasks. This seems like 
        a good idea at first because if there is an application already out there, employees would not have 
        to "reinvent the wheel." The drawback is that depending on the program, it could cost more in the 
        long-run do to licensing and upgrades. Also, the good thing about Ruby on Rails is that it provides 
        a great deal of functionality out-of-the-box and if it doesn't have it, there is probably a free 
        plugin to do that task. If the Department of Management Services was programming in a closed-source 
        framework then this may be viable, but since Rails is being utilized, the costs of this solution 
        outweigh the benefits.
