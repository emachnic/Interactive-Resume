                  This is the first professional site that I created. I went with a design based on the company's
                  informational brochure to keep the branding consistent across media.  This site conveys my clean
                  style that's very user friendly.

                  In Spring 2009, I was fortunate enough to be a part of the group that redesigned the
                  College of Information's Internship Application.  The site was a collaborative effort and
                  was focused on the process of applying for an internship.

                  In my Information Science course we talked a lot about presenting information properly.
                  This is the redesign of the old College of Information site and the actual design was done
                  by me and another group member.

                  This is the presentation on fixing the current "Night Nole" system at FSU for my Research and
                  Data Analysis course.  It was a collaborative group project and my part was to figure out how
                  to properly present our data.
